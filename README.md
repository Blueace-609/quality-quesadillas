# GREG - GeoguessR Expert Guessr

GeoguessR Expert Guessr (aka GREG) is a project that ties AI with geography, specifically the popular online game, GeoGuessr (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGuessr). We, the Quality Quesadillas Team (Christopher Xia, Tanay Agrawal, Aviv Gafter, Leo Kim, Sohma Nakagawa, Warren Zhou), tried our hand at creating an automated solver for GeoGuessr.

This repository contains code for running our website, our datasets, and other resources for developing an AI solution that can play GeoGuessr effectively.
